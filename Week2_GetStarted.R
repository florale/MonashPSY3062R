## Getting started in R

# this is an R script (.R)
# we use "hashtags" in R as comments or annotations 
# R won't run any lines that begin with a hashtag

1 + 1
# 2 + 2

## Which line does R run?

# Several ways to run a code:
# 1. Choose the lines you'd like to run
# 1.1. For a single line of code (e.g., line 7), click on the line you intend to run
# 1.2. For multiple lines (e.g., line 32 to 38), highlight the lines that you intend to run
# 2. Click "Run" at the top right corner of the script
# 2. Click CTRL+ENTER (for Windows) or CMD+ENTER (for MACs)
